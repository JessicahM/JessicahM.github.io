    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>After high school i have been fortunate enough to explore my many passions and
        take up several courses.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>3D animation</li>
          <li>Music production</li>
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>Network Engineering</li>
          <li>Editing</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have gained alot of experience in the past three years and natured my
          artistic roots in the process. I do not regret a second of it.</p>
    <h3>Job Experience</h3>
    <p>My job experience is not vast but i have done a few things i am proud of.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>An internship job in CopyCat limited, a company that specialises in
          IT and the supply of networking equipments</li>
        <li>A job as a waitress in a cafe. I loved the experience</li>
        <li>A sales and marketing job in ZoaTaka. Working with people was new and i learnt alot</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>My Current Endevours</h3>
    <p>I have decided to take up Programming in Moringa school because i truly want
      to attain a skill that not many people in Kenya have. A skill that will help me
      change the way Kenya is viewed in the technology sector. A skill that will
      bring great perks like travelling, which has always been a dream. I believe
    Moringa is the place to be.</p>
    <h3>Hobbies/Interests//Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hobbies</li>
      <p>I would describe myself as someone who has a very distinct taste when it comes to anything and everything.
      But one thing that says who i am is art. I love drawing and painting which i am still
      self teaching. I love music but not just any music. OLd school Hiphop and some Rock. Music is
      a big part of my life and that will never change.</p>
      <li>Interests</li>
      <p>My greatest interest is travelling the world, its more than an interest. I have alsways dreamt about
        seeing the world and living in different locales. Learning coding also has a line on my bucket list.
        I want to be the best, not only in kenya but also internationally. I want to meet the big names
        in the technology industry.</p>
      <li>Skills</li>
      <p>I have a few skills which i do not use or explore as much as i should but which i
        appreciate all the same. I can dance, i even joined a dance crew back in high school.
        We used to attend dance competitions with other school. We did not always win but it was fun.
        I can sing, not as well as most people but i do not crock which is awesome. I can
        draw, i have been drawing since pre school and im not qutting on it any time soon.</p>
